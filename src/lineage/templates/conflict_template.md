that you must resolve before merging this pull request!

## How to resolve the conflicts ##

1. Clone the `{{ pr_branch_name }}` branch locally:

    ```console
    git clone --single-branch --branch {{ pr_branch_name }} {{ ssh_url }}
    ```

1. Review each of the following files looking for [conflict-resolution markers](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#_basic_merge_conflicts):

    ```console
    {{#conflict_file_list}}
    {{.}}
    {{/conflict_file_list}}
    ```

1. Resolve each of the conflicts and `add` your changes to the branch:

    ```console
    git add {{#conflict_file_list}}{{.}} {{/conflict_file_list}}
    ```

1. Once all the changes have been added, `commit` and `push` the changes back to
GitHub:

    ```console
    git commit --message="Resolved Lineage conflicts."
    git push
    ```

1. Wait for all the automated tests to pass.
